Title: Bad Google repository signatures
Date: 2015-03-22T03:50:57Z
Summary: Google's package repositories occasionally return inconsistent data, causing validation failures.

**Update**: _I was able to get in touch with the Googlers responsible for the
[dl.google.com service], and the root cause for the mismatched signature problem
described below has been found and fixed. I now consistently receive from
Google's servers `Release` and `Release.gpg` files that pass apt's signature
validation on my home connection._

Google publishes [Linux software repositories] for several of their products,
including Google Chrome, which is available from the following apt source:

``` .boxed
deb http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/ stable main
```

These repositories are signed with an 8 year old 1024-bit DSA key:

``` .boxed
pub   1024D/7FAC5991 2007-03-08
      Key fingerprint = 4CCA 1EAF 950C EE4A B839  76DC A040 830F 7FAC 5991
uid                  Google, Inc. Linux Package Signing Key <linux-packages-keymaster@google.com>
sub   2048g/C07CB649 2007-03-08
```

Asymmetric 1024-bit keys are not considered strong enough and were, for
instance, [aggressively retired] from Google's SSL frontends almost two years
ago. Such short keys should not be used to protect the integrity of software
package repositories.

Note that this key has a longer 2048-bit ElGamal subkey, which is not actually
used to produce signatures, but only for encryption. In fact, only a signing key
is needed to sign the files in a secure apt repository, and, for instance, the
[archive keys] used to sign official debian.org repositories do not contain an
encryption subkey.

Since years, many users have reported an [error message] like the following when
running `apt-get update`:

``` .boxed
W: GPG error: http://dl.google.com stable Release: The following signatures were
invalid: BADSIG A040830F7FAC5991 Google, Inc. Linux Package Signing Key
<linux-packages-keymaster@google.com>
```

This error might resolve itself if `apt-get update` is run again. Apparently,
this is due to "[bad pushes]" occurring in the Google infrastructure. An example
of this can be seen in the following `curl` output:

``` .boxed

```

Note that both the `Release` and `Release.gpg` files were fetched with the same
HTTP connection, so the two files must have come from the same web frontend.
(Though, it is possible they were served by different backends.) However, the
detached signature in `Release.gpg` does not match the content in `Release`:

``` .boxed
gpgv: Signature made Fri 20 Mar 2015 12:01:58 AM EDT using DSA key ID 7FAC5991
gpgv: BAD signature from "Google, Inc. Linux Package Signing Key <linux-packages-keymaster@google.com>"
```

Performing the same pair of fetches again, the same `Release.gpg` file is
returned, but the `Release` file is slightly different:

``` .boxed

Note that the `Date` line in the `Release` file is different:

``` .boxed
@@ -6 +6 @@
-Date: Thu, 19 Mar 2015 22:55:29 +0000
+Date: Fri, 20 Mar 2015 04:02:02 +0000
```

The file hashes listed in the `Release` file are in a different order, as well,
though the actual hash values are the same. This `Release` file **does** have a
valid signature:

``` .boxed
gpgv: Signature made Fri 20 Mar 2015 12:01:58 AM EDT using DSA key ID 7FAC5991
gpgv: Good signature from "Google, Inc. Linux Package Signing Key <linux-packages-keymaster@google.com>"
```

Note that the `Release.gpg` files in the good and bad cases are the same, and
the same signature cannot cover two files with different content. Also note that
the same mis-signed content is [available via HTTPS], so it is probably not
caused by a MITM attack.

The possibility of skew between the `Release` and `Release.gpg` files is
precisely why [inline signed Release files] were introduced, but Google's
repositories use only the older format with a detached signature.

It would be nice if Google could fix the underlying bug in their infrastructure
that results in mis-signed repositories being published frequently, because it
trains users to ignore cryptographic failures.
